            Besides skiing, riding bicycles, wild nature, trams and trains, two of my biggest passions are programming and teaching. When I write programs and show others what I made, I put myself into happy child mode. Beside that, I enjoy long walks and like to play with animals outside.

            Although I am economist by vocation, I find fun in writing programs and see computer science as really impactful discipline. The world needs more computer scientists who understand economics, and more business leaders who understand principles of scientific computing. Understanding ways how businesses operate and ways how economy works, makes me ready to help organisations strengthen their impact in todays world.
